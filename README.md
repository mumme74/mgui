mgui
====

A gui library for Arduino based on Adafruit_GFX , currently uses only Adafruit 160x128 tft but it should be easy enough to port

It has a event system and different widgets

1. Label
2. Button
3. IconButton
4. Radio
5. CheckBox
6. Sliders Horizontal and Vertical


See example folder for more details

The event system can live on its own, free of the widgetsystem.


Currently tested on Teensy with a Adafruit 160x128 display
